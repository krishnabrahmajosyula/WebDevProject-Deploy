                        <li>ğŸ‘‰  To form the Mrigashirsha hand gesture, the thumb, index, and middle fingers are stretched straight, while the ring and little fingers are curved inward slightly.</li>
                        <li>ğŸ‘‰  In Bharatanatyam, Mrigashirsha is commonly used to symbolize a deer head or animal-like appearance, as "Mrigashirsha" translates to "deer head" in Sanskrit.</li>
                        <li>ğŸ‘‰  This hasta is primarily used to depict gentle animals or creatures, particularly a deer, emphasizing their elegance and beauty.</li>
                        <li>ğŸ‘‰ Mrigashirsha can signify emotions such as love, longing, or affection, often used in portraying scenes of romance or expressing admiration for a beloved.</li>
                        <li>ğŸ‘‰ In Bharatanatyam, Mrigashirsha can represent various natural elements, such as the softness of leaves, blossoms, or the gentle flow of water, connecting with nature.</li>
                        <li>ğŸ‘‰ Dancers use this gesture to represent delicate and shy female characters or mythical beings, often in romantic or dreamlike scenes.</li>
                        <li>ğŸ‘‰ The Mrigashirsha gesture, like many other mudras, is synchronized with rhythmic footwork and expressions in Bharatanatyam, adding elegance and depth to the storytelling.</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">ğŸ‘‰ This hasta is used to depict beauty, such as showing a womanâ€™s face or features, or describing beauty in nature.</li>
