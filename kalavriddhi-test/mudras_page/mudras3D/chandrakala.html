                        <li>ðŸ‘‰  The term "Chandrakala" combines "Chandra" (moon) and "Kala" (digit or phase), symbolizing a crescent moon.</li>
                        <li>ðŸ‘‰  Chandrakala Mudra symbolizes a crescent moon and can also represent the moon deity, Chandra.</li>
                        <li>ðŸ‘‰  To form Chandrakala, the thumb and index fingers are kept open while the other fingers are closed. The thumb points outward, creating a crescent shape.</li>
                        <li>ðŸ‘‰ It is used to depict deities like Shiva, who is often shown with a crescent moon on his head.</li>
                        <li>ðŸ‘‰ This mudra can represent other natural elements, such as water, due to the moonâ€™s connection with tides and water bodies.</li>
                        <li>ðŸ‘‰ In addition to Shiva, Chandrakala is associated with goddesses who embody moonlight or night, like Parvati or Durga in specific forms.</li>
                        <li>ðŸ‘‰ Often, dancers transition from Chandrakala to other mudras like Hamsasya or Tripataka for fluid storytelling, enhancing the moon's portrayal or related motifs.</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">ðŸ‘‰ While using Chandrakala, dancers employ soft and graceful facial expressions to match the serene quality of the moon.</li>
