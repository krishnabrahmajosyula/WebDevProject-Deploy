                        <li>ðŸ‘‰ In Shukatunda Mudra, the thumb and index finger are extended and curved to form a shape resembling a beak, while the other fingers are folded into the palm. This distinctive hand shape captures the essence of a parrot's beak.</li>

                        <li>ðŸ‘‰ This mudra is often used in conjunction with facial expressions (abhinaya) to convey specific emotions, adding depth to the narrative and allowing dancers to express subtleties in character portrayal.</li>
