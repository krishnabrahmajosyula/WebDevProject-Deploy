                        <li>ğŸ‘‰  Sarpashirsha translates to "snake head" in Sanskrit, representing the shape of a snake's hood.</li>
                        <li>ğŸ‘‰  To form Sarpashirsha, the fingers are kept close together, slightly bent, with the thumb tucked in â€“ resembling a cobraâ€™s raised hood.</li>
                        <li>ğŸ‘‰  This mudra is used to depict various elements, especially in classical Indian dance forms like Bharatanatyam, to convey different ideas, stories, or emotions.</li>
                        <li>ğŸ‘‰ Primarily, it represents a snakeâ€™s hood or the head of a snake, adding an element of strength, fear, and grace to the portrayal.</li>
                        <li>ğŸ‘‰ Sarpashirsha is often used to represent Lord Shivaâ€™s association with snakes, as he is frequently depicted with snakes around his neck.</li>
                        <li>ğŸ‘‰ This mudra is also used to show water, rivers, and flowing elements, due to the fluid and curved nature of its form.</li>
                        <li>ğŸ‘‰ Beyond snakes and water, Sarpashirsha can be used to depict activities like holding flowers, carrying food, or even applying tilak (a forehead mark).</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">ğŸ‘‰ Sarpashirsha adds elegance and dynamism to Bharatanatyam performances, showcasing the dancerâ€™s skill in shaping intricate hand gestures to create meaningful visuals.   </li>
