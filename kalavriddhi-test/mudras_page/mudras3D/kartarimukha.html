                        <li>ðŸ‘‰ The term "Kartari Mukha" translates to "scissors" in Sanskrit. This mudra resembles a pair of scissors and is often associated with cutting or separation.</li>
                        <li>ðŸ‘‰ In Kartari Mukha, the index and middle fingers are extended and held apart, while the ring and little fingers are folded down towards the palm, creating a shape that resembles open scissors.</li>
                        <li>ðŸ‘‰ This mudra symbolizes various concepts, such as cutting ties, separation, or even the act of clearing obstacles. It can also represent the action of pruning plants or trees, indicating nurturing and care.</li>
                        <li>ðŸ‘‰ Kartari Mukha is used in Bharatanatyam to convey specific themes or emotions, such as longing, separation, and movement, thereby enhancing the narrative of the performance.</li>
                        <li>ðŸ‘‰ As with other mudras, Kartari Mukha is typically accompanied by expressive facial gestures (abhinaya) that enhance its significance and clarify the message being conveyed.</li>
                        <li>ðŸ‘‰ Practicing this mudra can improve hand coordination, flexibility, and strength, contributing to overall body awareness and alignment in dance.</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">ðŸ‘‰ Kartari Mukha can be used in conjunction with other mudras to create a rich language of gestures, adding depth to the visual and emotional expression of the performance.</li>
