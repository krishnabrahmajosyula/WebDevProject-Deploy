            <h2>Origin of Bharatanatyam</h2>
            <p>Bharatanatyam is one of the oldest classical dance forms of India, originating in the temples of Tamil Nadu. This dance form was initially performed by Devadasis, women dedicated to temple service. It combines expressive hand gestures (mudras), intricate footwork, and storytelling through dance.</p>

            <h2>History of Bharatanatyam</h2>
            <p>The history of Bharatanatyam dates back to ancient times, with references found in texts like the Natya Shastra by Bharata Muni. Over the centuries, it evolved through various cultural influences and became a prominent performance art form in Indian classical dance. The revival of Bharatanatyam in the 20th century by pioneers like Rukmini Devi Arundale helped bring it to the global stage.</p>

            <h3>Elements of Bharatanatyam</h3>
            <p>Bharatanatyam is traditionally a team performance art that consists of a solo dancer, accompanied by musicians and one or more singers. It is described as classical art because the theory of musical notes, vocal performance, and the dance movement reflect ideas of the Sanskrit treatise Natya Shastra and other Sanskrit and Tamil texts, such as the Abhinaya Darpana.</p>
